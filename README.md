# Yet Another Gemini Client

As if there aren't too many of them anyways

![Screenshot](previews/Screenshot%201.png)

## "Features":

- Barely works
- Less "serious" than most other Gemini clients
- Table of contents (that you can't disable)
- Custom window frame (in exchange of performance)
- Is distributed as one executable (may drop this in the future)
- Partial Gopher support (while missing most of the basic features)
- Windows only
- Usable on a Windows 7
- Lots o' bugs

## To do (not in any particular order):

- Optimize
- Fix bugs
- Implement basic features (like redirects)
- Actually finish Gopher support
- Binary and image files support
- Favourites
- Feeds
- Settings
- Dark theme
- Come up with new ideas for the project
- Work on my other projects
